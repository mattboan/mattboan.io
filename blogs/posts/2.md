# Growing Hydroponic Chilli's

## Why?

Why make hydroponic chilli's at home? First of all why not? And for the obvious reasons; Fruit from seed to table quick and easy. By utilising the [Kratky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kratky_method) hydroponic system we can grow chilli's cheap, quick and easy.

To illustrate my point look at the difference below, I grew these chilli's from seeds around the same time, they were all around the same size before transplanting. The chilli's on the left are hydroponic while the chilli's on the right are grown in a rich potting mix.

## Kratky Method

The kratky method is basically just submerging the roots within a water nutrient rich solution. This allows us to always make sure the plant gets the perfect amount of all nutrients 24/7 around the clock. You could also combine this method with grow lights to get even faster growth and year round harvesting. See diagram below.

## My setup

All you have to do too replicate this setup is grab any UV resistant container 60L in my case. It's important to use a UV resistant conatiner to mitigate any algae. Then grab a growing medium I'm using rock wool grow cubes, and some net pots to hold the growing medium.

Once you've got all of your supplies ready just cut out some holes in the lid of your container to hold the net pots. Transplant your seedlings or seeds into the rock wool or growing medium, fill the container with water and add in some hydroponic nutrients (see bottle for recomended amount).

Now you're good to go! Keep an eye on your water levels making sure that the rock wool/growing medium stays nice and moist, crucial during the young plants life cycle. Once the plants roots are submereged just make sure that atleast 50% of the roots are submereged. This will help create a misty oxygen rich area for the top 50%.

## Modularity

I like growing in containers like this as someone who has limited space with possiblity of moving it's nice to know I can pick up and move these units quite easily.

I would love to create a modular tower design, but if I'm going to do that I'm going to have to do it right with all the bells and whistles.

## Future Aspects

In the future I will be adding some electronics to easily monitor and ensure optimal growing conditions.

I'll be posting that as a project so make sure you subscribe so you don't miss it.
