# Nokia Cube | Retro Desktop Notification Center

## Overview

The Nokia cube is a tiny computer (ESP32S2) using a tiny screen from the late 90s - early 2000s (Nokia 5110 LCD | PCD8544). It can be programmed to do just about anything within its 84x48 pixel bounds. In my case I've decided to use it as a notifications hub, starting off with a simple Weather centre.

### Personal Goals

I chose to work on this project because I had a surplus of Nokia 5110 LCDs lying around and I also wanted to expand my skillsets in regard to Embedded Systems and thought coding a display driver would yield some pretty nifty practical results. Make the difficult fun!

### Functionality Goals

So just a high-level overview of what we are aiming for here.

<strong>Overall system goals:</strong>

-   Connect to WiFi
-   Make HTTP Requests to get information
-   Display information in regular intervals
-   Expandable code base -> Allow for additional types of notifications

<strong>Nokia 5110 LCD | PCD8544 Driver goals:</strong>

-   Initialise Display
-   Draw pixels
-   Draw lines
-   Draw circles
-   Draw text
-   Draw bitmaps
-   Scrolling text

## Display Driver

So the Nokia 5110 LCD is an LCD driven by the Philips PCD8544 IC Display Controller, here's the link to the [datasheet](https://voidstudios.com.au/pdf/pcd8544.pdf).

If you would like to know more about the display driver I have created, check it out [here](/projects/pcd8544-lcd-driver-esp-32).

## 3D CAD Modelling

Of course, I wanted this thing out of the breadboard and into a nice enclosure. I utilised Fusion 360 "Hobby" Edition here to create a pretty cool-looking enclosure.

Link to model [here](https://github.com/mattboan/nokia-cube).

## Electronics

So to connect the PCD8544 Display to the ESP32S2 I used this configuration. On a more generic ESP32 Dev board, I recommend connecting DIN to 23 and CLK to 18.

<strong>ESP32S2 ------- PCD8544</strong><br />
35 -----> DIN<br />
26 -----> CLK<br />
2 -----> DC<br />
3 -----> RESET<br />
VCC ----> BL<br />
3v3 ----> VCC<br />
GND ----> GND<br />

### ESP32S2 Dev Module

This board is a tiny ESP32S2 dev kit, can buy one [here.](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003145192016.html)

### Nokia 5110 | PCD8544 Display

The Nokia 5110 LCD is a monochromatic LCD driven by the PCD8544 display controller that was used in the old Nokia cell phones around the late 90s to early 00s. It has a fairly simple set of instructions making writing the display driver relatively easy compared to other TFT LCDs I've worked with.

## Software

So overall the software is quite simple please find repo [here](https://github.com/mattboan/nokia-cube).

Overall what the code does:

1. Connect to WiFi
2. Start running a task
3. The task calls an HTTP weather server every x ms
4. Parse JSON results
5. Output weather results
6. Repeat 3-5 over and over.

Here is the result

### ESP-IDF

I like to use the ESP-IDF because it gives me the greatest level of control over say the Arduino IDE. Working with embedded systems you will run into resource constraints. Being able to turn off certain features, and tweak and tinker with as much control as possible is ideal in such a case.

Also having a cli makes things more exciting. Although for you more visual thinkers there is a VSCode plugin if needed, but if you are going down that road I would suggest PlatformIO.

<br />
<br />

## Assembly

Assembly is quite simple:

1. 3D print the enclosure
2. Assemble the three pieces using the M4 Bolts
3. Solder up the connections
4. Hot glue the ESP32S2 Mini into place ensuring the USB-C connector is aligned
5. Hot glue the Nokia 5110 LCD Module onto the facing plate
6. Squish the two pieces together
7. Screw into place
8. Power on

<br />
<br />

## Wrap up

This was a cool project that brought many new learning outcomes, learning some basic algorithms such as Bresenham's line algorithm, Bresenham's circle algorithm, learning about ESP32 partitions, the ESP-IDF, the WiFi interface, WiFi Provisioning, and much more. Also, any chance I get to 3D print something is always a well-spent one.

Overall I'm looking forward to getting this little device to display more, the options are endless: Spotify Currently playing, in-room temperature, crypto ticker, docker container status on my local server, etc, etc.

In the future having some control buttons and exposing the reset buttons would be great allowing for easier programming of the ESP32S2 as well as expanding the functionality.
